    <p><span class="head-title">What was hard to do:</span> The entire project was a significant challenge as I had never worked with Node.js, Express, and JavaScript before. In addition, never dealt with building a whole project from scratch. The most challenging parts for me were at first to structure the project, then managing the routes and handling data on the local disk with JSON files. Afterwards, building the Feed Page and fetching all user's posts and assigning for each post his username and displaying it on screen. Additionally, managing the "Following Users" Page and the Admin Page posed challenges, but after overcoming all the obstacles and errors, I was really proud of myself and I really liked that in web-internet applications you can see right away when you make progress and that gave me the confidence and power to push back when I was frustrated.</p>
    <p><span class="title">My partner is Lee Jaichenco - 315467977.</span></p>
    <p>I was mainly in charge for the server routes and the web architecture, saving the data in json files, handeling the Admin page and doing the tests file.
        Lee was in charge of the website design, including the jsx pages structures, css. In addition, she handeled the static pages.
        Although each had her own responsibilities, we helped each other when needed.
